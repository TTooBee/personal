## 2025/05/01

### Study-2025/05/01
- [x] Signal and Systems.
  - Z-transform.

### Experiments-2025/05/01
- [x] Base code train with 100 epochs(same setting with [[Experimetns-2025/04/30]]).
> Result : [[Experiments#2025/05/01]]
> Server : [[Server#2025/05/01]]
- [x] Set all the LPC related parameters to 1 and test the code.
> Result : Do this with a single epoch to test the code.
> Server : [[Server#2025/05/01]]
- [x] Set LPC classification loss(`loss_a_freq_cls`, `loss_res_cls`) to 1.
> Result : [[Experiments#2025/05/01]]
- [x] Experiment with `comp` code(`noise_prob` 0.0).
> Result : [[Experiments#2025/05/01]]
> Server : [[Server#2025/05/01]]

### Code-2025/05/01
- [x] Write the code : `analysis/class_similarity.py`.
  > This code is to see the similarity between the base classes.
- [-] Write code that shows the similar classes.
  - Not just similar classes. Rank of similarity.

### Tomorrow-2025/05/01
- Experiment with `comp` code with `noise_prob` set to 0.8.

## 2025/05/02

### Idea-2025/05/02
- [ ] Should think about evidence that formant and residual embeddings shape the vector space as I thought.
