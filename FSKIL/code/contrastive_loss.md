# contrastive_loss

## 2025-04-01
- Positive pairs and the negative pairs are needed to apply contrastive loss to the model.
- What I'm trying to do is not just a contrastive learning. I want to match the speech embeddings and the audio embeddings.
- I have to use `batch label` to control the batch data.
