# fewer_base_classes

## 2025/04/11
- When we look at the result of the model, the gap of the unseen accuracy between comp and form-res decreases
  as the session increases.
- This could mean that if the base session is shorter than the current setup(and longer incremental session),
  this can show me the strength of the form-res model.
